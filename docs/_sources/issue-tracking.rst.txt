Issues can be the development plan and maintance of the project. Good issues are unitary elements that can be solved.
Some examples:

- Change colormap of topoplot to "red-blue" (*improvement*)
- Implement detrend (*new feature*)
- Temporary files are not removed after end of processing (*bug*)

This *improvement*, *new feature*, and *bug* are labels that you can use to mark and filter the issues.
