Introduction to Git
===================

`Git <https://git-scm.com/>`_ is a version-control system. There are others, such as: Mercurial, Subversion, etc.
Git is by far the most used.

Repositories can be hosted online on web platforms, e.g. GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket. They differ on high-level features, for example, issue tracking, contributors management, integrations, basic features but not on the git core functionalities.

`Aalto Version Control System <https://version.aalto.fi/>`_ is developed on top of GitLab.

Material
--------

There is plenty of material available on the internet, but is a little bit hard to find straightforward instructions/explanations.
I collected a few websites that is worth checking:

- `Introduction to Git: Code Refinery 2019 (~285 min) <https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/>`_
- `First steps with Git <https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/setting-up-a-repository>`_
- `Training with Git Immersion <http://gitimmersion.com/>`_
- `Configure SSH keys <https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent>`_
- `MATLAB Git set up <https://se.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/set-up-git-source-control.html>`_
- `Aalto Git cheatsheet <https://users.aalto.fi/~darstr1/cheatsheets/git-cheatsheet.pdf>`_ 

What is Git?
------------

Git works by tracking *changes in files* and not by *manipulating files*! (What?)

With version control you can travel back and forth in the history of your code.

Git allows you to automatically combine and synccode code that is edited simultaniously in multiple places.
